            <p>Pizza is also life</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>10 ounces lasagna noodles</li>
                <li>1.5 lbs ground beef</li>
                <li>3 cups cottage cheese</li>
                <li>2 eggs</li>
                <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
                <li>2 tbsp dried parsley</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 (6 oz) can tomato paste</li>

            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Set the oven rack to the middle position. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190ºC)</li>
                <li>Bring water and 1 tablespoon salt to a boil. Cook pasta according to package directions, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until al dente, about 8 minutes. Carefully remove the lasagna noodles and transfer them to a sheet pan lined with clean kitchen towels. Place them in a single layer, to keep them from sticking together. Set aside until ready to use.</li>
                <li>Add just enough sauce to lightly cover the bottom of the dish to prevent sticking.</li>

            </ol>
